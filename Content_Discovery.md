## Content Discovery in Web Application Security ðŸŽ‰

In the context of web application security, content can encompass a wide variety of data such as files, videos, images, backups, website features, and more. When we talk about content discovery, we're not referring to the obvious elements visible on a website.

Instead, we're focusing on uncovering the hidden or less obvious contentâ€”those that are not immediately presented to users and may not have been intended for public access. Discovering this content is crucial, 
as it can reveal sensitive information, overlooked features, or vulnerable points that could be exploited by attackers.



I completed the **Content Discovery** room and earned a badge recognising my achievement!
